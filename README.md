### Hi there 👋

### About Me
I studied Mechanical Engineering but destiny brought me to IT World and I started my career with Infosys. Initially i was trained in basic IT skills and then i got mapped to Telecom Domain Project of US client (Fortune 500 Company).

I started exploring the Digital Technologies and started learning Data Science through various platforms and as a result I am adept at
• Collecting, Analyzing and Interpreting data
• Develop and Deploy visualization dashboards (Ex. Power BI, Tableau)
• Implementing Machine Learning models to solve real life problems

I take part in online Data Science related hackathons and keep my learning curve growing. I love to share knowledge and as of now i have motivated & trained 40+ team members to explore & learn Digital Technologies.

My current location is Pune, IN and my hometown is near Delhi, IN. I love to travel and explore places. I also keep an eye on major events happening around the world and read about issues related to National Security.
